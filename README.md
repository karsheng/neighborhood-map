## Neighborhood Map

This app allows you to search for any places of your interest and populate them on the map and list. You can get more information of the place e.g. full address, opening hours, Foursquare check-ins etc. by clicking the name in the **Results** list or the icon on the map.

You can even filter the results too (by text, open now and rating)!  

Enjoy!

#### Notes to reviewer
1. Source code is stored in the `src` folder.
1. Foursquare API is used to get check-in counts for places.
1. **Open Now** and **Rating Above** filters will not work properly on the initial places which were hard-coded as these information change with time.
